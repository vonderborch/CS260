# CS260
Assignments and Labs for CS260 (Introduction to Computer Architecture) at WSU taken in Spring 2013.

This repository contains all my code and miscellaneous files for the class that I could find. There is no guarentee on any of it working perfectly.

All programs are written in Assembly for Mips, and were tested using MARS ( http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/ ).

- HW3
  - HW3-1: Fibonacci sequence
  - HW3-2: Fibonacci sequence using stacks I think.
  - HW3-3: Sums up numbers.
- HW4
  - HW4-1: Calculates the length of a string.
  - HW4-2: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
  - HW4-3: Checks length of two strings and whether they  are palindromes.
  - HW4-4: Runs the test palindrome program (testPal.asm, providedby professor) on the palindrome functions written in HW4-1 and HW4-2.
- HW5
  - HW5-1: Swaps contents oof $a0 and $a1.
  - HW5-2: Partitions an array of values.
  - HW5-3: Uses QuickSort to sort an array of values.
  - HW5-4: Calls the bute test program (butetest.asm, provided by professor) to test the implementation of QuickSort.
  - HW5-5: Ignore. Commented out, was originally for my own testing of QuickSort, but I got rid of it at some point.
- HW6
  - HW6-1: Solves some basic equations.
- HW7 (actually HW9)
  - HW9-1: A game of Frogger.
